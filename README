## My process
Started with the desktop html layout, then created a css file and added styling, once the styling was complete I created media queries to make the page responsive to a mobile device with the width of 375px.

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

I will continue to attempt using pure css without any frameworks and trying out new techniques.
